## Python String Exercise 1

A basic exercise demonstrating a few string and array manipulation operations in
python. Feel free to use for whatever.

This branch only contains the input data and the skeleton solution file. For an
example solution and test-case generator, check out the `solution` branch.

### The Problem

We asked 16 dragons to tell us their favorite flavors of ice cream, as well as
their favorite toppings. The results are stored in the file 'inputs.json', but
they were corrupted by dark magic. You need to clean up the text and then find
out how many dragons liked each flavor. You can also display each individual
dragon's response. More details can be found in `analyze_data.py`.
